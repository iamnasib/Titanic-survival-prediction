# About This Project:

This project is a Titanic Survival Prediction model.

The goal of this project is to predict the Survival of the people using basic machine learning techniques. I’ve used scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, and joblib to train and save the model efficiently.

Once you install the required dependencies from requirements.txt, you can run the Python script to:

Train the model on the housing dataset

Automatically save the trained model and data pipeline as model.pkl and pipeline.pkl

## How to Run
- Install dependencies:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run python file

### Note about test.ipynb
test.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file that I used initially to do EDA and test the whole process to get the best result.

Predicted csv will be saved to titanic-predictions.csv
